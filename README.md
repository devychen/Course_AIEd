# Course_AI_in_Education


### Term Paper:  

Idea: Multiagent as peers x Education

More specifically:  
- Using AI agents to simulate learning environment, with AI being the classmates (not or not only as teachers as in previous studies we've seen).  
- With the aim to guide future downstream application of multi-agents in simulating studying environment, this paper wants to do a relatively systemantic review on the following aspects:
1. Primarily, how to simulate the environments, what factors should be considered.
2. How the interactions of agents and human/agent teachers, agents and human classmates influence the performance of students.
3. Else tbc.
